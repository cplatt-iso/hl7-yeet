# Admin Status Fix Summary

## Problem

User `chris.platt@gmail.com` is an admin in the database (`is_admin = True`), but admin features were not showing in the UI after login.

## Root Cause

The frontend `AuthContext` was attempting to read the `is_admin` flag from the JWT token payload, but the backend was not including `is_admin` as a claim in the JWT token. The backend only returned `is_admin` in the login/register response body, but the frontend wasn't using it correctly.

## Solution

Modified `/home/icculus/projects/yeeter/src/context/AuthContext.jsx` to:

1. **Read `is_admin` from API response** instead of JWT token payload in all auth functions:
   - `login()` - Now extracts `is_admin` from response
   - `register()` - Now extracts `is_admin` from response  
   - `googleLogin()` - Now extracts `is_admin` from response

2. **Persist user data in localStorage** to maintain admin status across page reloads:
   - Store `userData` (including `is_admin`) in localStorage when user logs in
   - Restore `userData` from localStorage on app initialization
   - Clear `userData` from localStorage on logout

## Changes Made

### Before

```javascript
// Login was trying to read is_admin from JWT token
const payload = JSON.parse(atob(access_token.split('.')[1]));
const userData = {
    username: username,
    is_admin: payload.is_admin || false  // ❌ Not in token!
};
```

### After

```javascript
// Now reads is_admin directly from API response
const { access_token, username, is_admin } = response;
const userData = {
    username: username,
    is_admin: is_admin || false  // ✓ From response
};
localStorage.setItem('userData', JSON.stringify(userData));  // ✓ Persist it
```

## How to Test

1. **Log out** of the application (to clear old session data)
2. **Log back in** with your credentials (chris.platt at gmail.com)
3. You should now see the **Admin tab** and all admin features

## Alternative Solution (Not Implemented)

An alternative would be to add `is_admin` as a JWT claim in the backend:

```python
# In app/routes/auth_routes.py
access_token = create_access_token(
    identity=str(user.id),
    additional_claims={"is_admin": user.is_admin}
)
```

This wasn't necessary since the current solution is simpler and works well.
