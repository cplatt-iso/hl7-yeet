# Fix: Terminology Refresh Progress Not Showing

## Problem

The terminology refresh was running in the background successfully, but:

- No progress updates were appearing in the UI
- The screen wasn't updating with download status
- It appeared to "loop forever" with no feedback
- The backend logs showed 628 tables being processed, but the frontend showed nothing

## Root Cause

The `TerminologyManagement` component was trying to use `socket` from the `AuthContext`, but the socket was set to `null` in AuthContext:

```javascript
const { socket } = useAuth();  // socket is null!

useEffect(() => {
    if (!socket) return;  // Always returns early, never listens to events
    socket.on('terminology_status', handleStatusUpdate);
}, [socket]);
```

The Socket.IO connection was disabled/removed from the AuthContext, so the component never received the real-time progress updates being emitted by the backend.

## Solution Applied

Modified `/home/icculus/projects/yeeter/src/components/TerminologyManagement.jsx` to create its own Socket.IO connection:

### Changes Made

1. **Added Socket.IO imports:**

   ```javascript
   import { io } from 'socket.io-client';
   import { API_BASE_URL } from '../api/config';
   ```

2. **Created a socket ref:**

   ```javascript
   const socketRef = useRef(null);
   ```

3. **Set up Socket.IO connection in useEffect:**

   ```javascript
   useEffect(() => {
       const token = localStorage.getItem('authToken');
       const socketUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_SOCKET_URL || API_BASE_URL;
       
       socketRef.current = io(socketUrl, {
           auth: { token },
           transports: ['websocket', 'polling'],
           reconnection: true,
           reconnectionDelay: 1000,
           reconnectionAttempts: 5
       });

       socketRef.current.on('terminology_status', handleStatusUpdate);
       
       // Cleanup on unmount
       return () => {
           if (socketRef.current) {
               socketRef.current.off('terminology_status', handleStatusUpdate);
               socketRef.current.disconnect();
           }
       };
   }, []);
   ```

## How It Works Now

1. User clicks "Refresh All V2 Terminology"
2. Frontend creates a Socket.IO connection to the backend
3. Backend starts the refresh in a background task
4. Backend emits `terminology_status` events with progress updates
5. Frontend receives these events and updates the UI in real-time:
   - Progress message: "Downloading table 0001 (1/628)..."
   - Progress bar: Updates from 0% to 100%
6. When complete, shows success/error toast notification
7. Refreshes the terminology statistics

## Testing

1. Go to Admin → HL7 Terminology
2. Click "Refresh All V2 Terminology"
3. You should now see:
   - ✅ Real-time progress updates
   - ✅ Progress bar showing percentage
   - ✅ Status messages for each table being downloaded
   - ✅ Final success/error notification
   - ✅ Updated statistics when complete

## Benefits

- ✅ **Real-time feedback** - User sees exactly what's happening
- ✅ **Progress tracking** - Visual progress bar and detailed messages
- ✅ **Better UX** - No more "black box" operation
- ✅ **Proper error handling** - Errors are displayed to the user
- ✅ **Independent connection** - Doesn't rely on global auth socket

## Notes

The fix requires rebuilding the frontend. After running `docker compose up -d --build`, the terminology refresh will show proper real-time progress updates.
