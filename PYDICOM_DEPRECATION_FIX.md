# Fix: Pydicom Deprecation Warnings

## Warnings Addressed

Fixed three pydicom deprecation warnings that will cause errors in pydicom v4.0:

1. `'Dataset.is_little_endian' will be removed in v4.0`
2. `'Dataset.is_implicit_VR' will be removed in v4.0`
3. `'write_like_original' is deprecated and will be removed in v4.0`

## Changes Made

### File: `/home/icculus/projects/yeeter/app/util/dicom_generator.py`

#### 1. Removed deprecated `is_little_endian` and `is_implicit_VR` properties

**Old approach (deprecated):**

```python
ds = Dataset()
ds.file_meta = file_meta
ds.is_little_endian = True
ds.is_implicit_VR = True
```

**New approach:**

```python
ds = Dataset()
ds.file_meta = file_meta
# Transfer syntax is set in file_meta, no need to set deprecated attributes
```

The transfer syntax (which defines byte order and VR encoding) is already properly set in the `file_meta.TransferSyntaxUID` field. Setting it there is the correct approach, and the deprecated properties are no longer needed.

**Locations fixed:**

- Line ~898 (SR generation function)
- Line ~1023 (DICOM file generation function)

#### 2. Replaced `write_like_original=False` with `enforce_file_format=True`

**Old approach (deprecated):**

```python
ds.save_as(filepath, write_like_original=False)
```

**New approach:**

```python
ds.save_as(filepath, enforce_file_format=True)
```

The `enforce_file_format` parameter replaces `write_like_original` with clearer semantics. Setting it to `True` ensures the file is written according to the DICOM standard format.

**Locations fixed:**

- Line ~1187 (Main DICOM file save)
- Line ~1219 (SR file save)

## Technical Details

### Transfer Syntax

The transfer syntax UID in the file metadata already specifies:

- Byte order (little endian vs big endian)
- VR encoding (implicit vs explicit)
- Compression scheme (if any)

In this codebase, we use `ImplicitVRLittleEndian` which is set in `file_meta.TransferSyntaxUID`. This makes the deprecated dataset-level properties redundant.

### File Format Enforcement

The new `enforce_file_format` parameter:

- `True`: Writes the file according to DICOM Part 10 format (with file meta information)
- `False`: May write without proper file meta information header

For PACS compatibility, we want `enforce_file_format=True` (equivalent to the old `write_like_original=False`).

## Testing

After rebuilding, the warnings should no longer appear in the logs when generating DICOM files. The functionality remains identical - only the API calls have been updated to use non-deprecated methods.

## Benefits

- ✅ No deprecation warnings in logs
- ✅ Forward compatible with pydicom v4.0
- ✅ Clearer, more explicit code
- ✅ Same functionality maintained
