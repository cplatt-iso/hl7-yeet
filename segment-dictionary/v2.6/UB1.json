Only billing/claims fields that do not exist in other HL7 defined segments appear in this segment. The codes listed as examples are not an exhaustive or current list.\n\nPrior to V2.6, this segment was published as a UB-82 specific segment, but has been widely implemented for usage with UB-82 and/or UB-92 data. With the publication of the UB-92 (in 1992) and the HIPAA requirements in the US (2004), this segment is technically no longer applicable for the UB-82 which is no longer in use. However, the segment is often used internally to message data from a patient registration to a patient accounting system. It has been 'generalized' in V2.6 for wider applicability.",
