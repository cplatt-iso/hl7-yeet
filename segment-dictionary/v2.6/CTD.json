  "description": "The CTD segment may identify any contact personnel associated with a patient referral message and its related transactions. The CTD segment will be paired with a PRD segment. The PRD segment contains data specifically focused on provider information in a referral. While it is important in an inter-enterprise transaction to transmit specific information regarding the providers involved (referring and referred-to), it may also be important to identify the contact personnel associated with the given provider. For example, a provider receiving a referral may need to know the office manager or the billing person at the institution of the provider who sent the referral. This segment allows for multiple contact personnel to be associated with a single provider.",

An application and facility identifier carried in the facility field specifies the identification of the contacts location.

That is, the facility field will contain an application identifier and facility identifier which describe the location of this contact. However, it should be noted that they may describe a different location because the contact location being referenced in this field may not be the location from which the message originated, which is being described by the MSH.",
