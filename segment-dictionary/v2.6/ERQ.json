If it is valued, the responding system is required to echo it back as the first field in the query acknowledgment segment (QAK). This field differs from MSA-2Message control ID in that its value remains constant for each message (i.e., all continuation messages) associated with the query, whereas MSA-2-Message control ID may vary with each continuation message, since it is associated with each individual message, not the query as a whole.",

The ERP response message returns the contents of the \u201cregister a patient\u201d message defined in Chapter 3.

A simple list of values (i.e., a onedimensional array) may be passed instead of a single value by separating each value with the subcomponent delimiter: \u201c<segment field name> ^ <value1&value2 &...>.\u201d Refer to Section 5.10.5.1.5, \u201cEQL-4 EQL Query Statement (ST) 00710,\u201d for segment field name definition conventions. For example, a value of \u201c@PID.19^123-45-6789\u201d could be combined with the A04 event identifier to request patient registration data for the patient with the social security number 123-45-6789.",
