Prior to v2.5, the narrative conflicted with the component model. There was an ARB decision to bring the component model into conformity with the narrative. For versions prior to v2.5, the expected format would utilize the component separator (|10^20|); however for v2.5 the format will utilize the sub-component separator (|10&20|).\n8",
