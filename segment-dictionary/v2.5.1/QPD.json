If this field is valued, the responding system is required to echo it back as the first field in the query acknowledgement segment (QAK).\n\n[Implementation considerations: It is not necessary to value this field in implementations where the only return message on the socket will be the response to the query that was just sent. Conversely, in an \u201casynchronous\u201d implementation where many queries, responses, and other messages may be communicated bidirectionally over the same socket, it is essential that this field be valued so that the Client knows to which query the Server is responding.]",
