  "description": "The NSC segment is used to inform (NMR query response) or announce (NMD unsolicited update) the start-up, shut-down, and/or migration (to a different cpu or file-server/file-system) of a particular application.\n\nUsage Notes: Fields 2-9. These are not applicable (\u201cn/a\u201d) when the type of change being requested or reported is start-up or shut-down. If the change is of type \"M\", at least one of fields 2-5 must be different from its corresponding field in range 6-9.\n\nFields 4-5, 8-9. See definitions for the MSH, message header segment, for fields 3-4, for system and facility. \"Application\" is available for interfacing with lower level protocols. \"Facility\" is entirely site-defined.\n\nFields 2-3, 6-7.
