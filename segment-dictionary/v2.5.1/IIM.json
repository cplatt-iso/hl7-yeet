  "description": "The Inventory Item Master segment (IIM) contains information about the stock of product that can be used to fulfill an ordered test/service. All of the fields in this segment describe the test/service and other basic attributes pertaining to Service Item defined within an Other Observation/Service Item master file. This segment is related to centrally stocked or supply management concerns.\n\nNote: We recognize that the M15 Inventory Item Master File trigger event and the IIM inventory item master segment is a limited implementation. There is a comprehensive Materials Management message in development for inclusion in the next release. For further information contact the Scheduling and Logistics TC. This will be coordinated with the Control/Query TC and the Orders and Observations TC.",
