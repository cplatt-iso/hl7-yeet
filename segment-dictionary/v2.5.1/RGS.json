  "description": "The RGS segment is used to identify relationships between resources identified for a scheduled event. This segment can be used, on a site specified basis, to identify groups of resources that are used together within a scheduled event, or to describe some other relationship between resources. To specify related groups of resources within a message, begin each group with an RGS segment, and then follow that RGS with one or more of the Appointment Information segments (AIG, AIL, AIS, or AIP).\n\nIf a message does not require any grouping of resources, then specify a single RGS in the message, and follow it with all of the Appointment Information segments for the scheduled event. (At least one RGS segment is required in each message \u2013 even if no grouping of resources is required \u2013 to allow parsers to properly understand the message.)",
