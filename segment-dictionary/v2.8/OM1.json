These distinctions are used in IUPAC and LOINC standard codes. Defined categories are listed in HL7 Table 0254 - Kind of Quantity.\n\nThe distinctions of true quantities in this table are based primarily on dimensional analyses. The table contains a number of \"families,\" those related to simple counts (number, number concentration, etc.), to mass (mass, mass concentration, etc.), to enzyme activity (catalytic content, catalytic concentration, etc.), and molar or equivalents (substance content, substance concentration).\n\nBy this classification, a glucose (in the US) would be classed as a mass concentration. A sodium would be classed as a substance concentration. Within the family, a total amount should be described as the unadorned variant; e.g., the property of measure for a patient's weight would be mass, not mass content. Most chemical measures produce concentrations, as exemplified by sodium and glucose. However, a 24-hour urine protein is not a mass concentration, but a mass rate (mass per unit time). The content variants (e.g., mass content, substance content) are used to reflect an amount per mass (usually) of tissue.\n\nThis attribute would be valued in a master file only if the service sending the master file classified observations by their principle of measurement.",

Interval measures most often apply to urine and stool specimens (e.g., 24-hour urines, 3-day stool fats). They also apply to clinical measurements such as urine outputs, which are reported as shift totals and 24-hour totals, and event counts on physiologic monitors such as the number of PVCs on a 24-hour Holter monitor.\n\nThis field would only be valued in a transaction if the service sending this master file message classified its observation by point versus time interval. This field is not used to record the time collection interval for a particular sample. It is used to specify a characteristic of an observation which has a defined normal range and to distinguish observations of the same kind but observed over varying periods of time. A spot urine sodium would have PT stored in this field. A 24-hour urine sodium and a 24-hour Holter monitor would have 24H stored here. This attribute would only be valued if the filling service classified its observations by timing. Refer to User-defined Table 0255 - Duration Categories for suggested values.",
