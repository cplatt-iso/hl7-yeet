  "description": "The Clinical Relationship segment contains the data necessary to relate two data elements within and/or external to the message at run-time. It also includes information about the relationship.\n\nRelationships are constrained to being between explicit segments of messages rather than beween the identities of entities they reference. Segments are available within the message but related persistent information may not be. Because of the transient nature of messages applications must manage the associations with entities which persist outside or across messages.\nExamples:\n- Problem is a consequence of a diagnosis.\n- Diagnosis is supported by observation.\n- Observation is a manifestation of a diagnosis.\n- Complication is a consequence of a procedure.",
