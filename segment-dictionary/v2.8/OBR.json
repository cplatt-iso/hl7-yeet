  "short_description": "Observation Request",
  "description": "The Observation Request (OBR) segment is used to transmit information specific to an order for a diagnostic study or observation, physical exam, or assessment.\n\nThe Observation Request segment defines the attributes of a particular request for diagnostic services (e.g., laboratory, EKG) or clinical observations (e.g., vital signs or physical exam). When a placer requests a given set of observations, always include an order segment. For lab tests, the information in the order segment usually applies to a single specimen. However, there is not a one-to-one relationship between specimen and tests ordered. Different test batteries will usually require their own order segments even when they can be performed on a single specimen. In this case, the specimen information must be duplicated in each of the order segments that employ that specimen. For other diagnostic studies, e.g., chest X-ray, a separate order segment will usually be generated for each diagnostic study.\n\nThough multiple observation batteries can be ordered on a single order segment, the observation filler shall generate a separate order segment for each battery that it processes independently, e.g., electrolyte, CBC, vital signs. When reporting the observations, the filling service shall copy the appropriate order (specimen) information from the original order segment into each of the new order segments so that a separate \"order\" segment is returned to the placer as a \"header\" for each separate battery of observations.\n\nIn the event that an ordered battery of observations cannot be performed, e.g., because of hemolysis on a blood sample, an order segment will be returned to the placer with OBR-25-result status equal to X (to indicate that the study was not performed). In this case, no observation segments will be transmitted.\n\nWhen observations are successfully completed, the message returned to the placer will include the order segment (OBR) followed by observation (OBX) segments for each distinct observation generated by the order (see Chapter 7). The number of such observation segments will depend upon the number of individual measurements performed in the process.\n\nOBX segments can be sent by the placer along with an order to provide the filling service with clinical data needed to interpret the results. (See Chapter 7 for OBX details.)\n\nThe daggered (+) items in this segment are created by the filler, not the placer. They are valued by the filler as needed when the OBR segment is returned as part of a report.\n\nThe starred (*) fields are only relevant when an observation is associated with a specimen. These are completed by the placer when the placer obtains the specimen. They are completed by the filler when the filler obtains the specimen.\n\nOBR-7-observation date/time and OBR-8-observation end date/time (flagged with #) are the physiologically relevant times. In the case of an observation on a specimen, they represent the start and end of the specimen collection. In the case of an observation obtained directly from a subject (e.g., BP, Chest X-ray), they represent the start and end time of the observation.\n\nIn the reporting of clinical data, the OBR serves as the report header. It identifies the observation set represented by the following atomic observations. It includes the relevant ordering information when that applies. It contains many of the attributes that usually apply to all of the included observations.\n\nWhen a set of observations is ordered, the order message contains an OBR segment. However, observations can be collected and reported without an antecedent order. When observations are reported, the report message also includes one or more OBR segments. So, the OBR segment is like a turn-around document. Some fields in the OBR segment apply only to the ordering message and some to the reporting message. To those familiar with healthcare procedures, these should be obvious from their names (e.g., transcriptionist or principal result interpreter could only apply to the reporting phase). However, we have also flagged them in the OBR HL7 Attribute Table to indicate whether placer, filler, or both may send data in a given field.",

The first component is a string that identifies an individual order (i.e., ORC segment and associated order detail segment). A limit of fifteen (15) characters is suggested but not required. It is assigned by the placer (ordering application). An implementation is HL7 compliant when the number of characters for this field is increased to accommodate applications that require a greater number of characters for the Placer order number. It identifies an order uniquely among all orders from a particular ordering application. The second through fourth components contain the application ID of the placing application in the same form as the HD data type (section 2.A.36, \"HD \u2013 Hierarchic designator\"). The second component, namespace ID, is a user-defined coded value that will be uniquely associated with an application. A limit of six (6) characters is suggested but not required. A given institution or group of intercommunicating institutions should establish a unique list of applications that may be potential placers and fillers and assign unique application IDs. The components are separated by component delimiters.\n\nSee ORC-2-placer order number (section 4.5.1.2) for information on when this field must be valued.\n\nA given institution or group of intercommunicating institutions should establish a list of applications that may be potential placers and fillers of orders and assign each a unique application ID. The application ID list becomes one of the institution's master dictionary lists that is documented in Chapter 8. Since third-party applications (those other than the placer and filler of an order) can send and receive ORM and ORR messages, the placer application ID in this field may not be the same as any sending and receiving application on the network (as identified in the MSH segment).\n\nORC-2-placer order number is the same as OBR-2-placer order number. If the placer order number is not present in the ORC, it must be present in the associated OBR and vice versa. If both fields, ORC-2-placer order number and OBR-2-placer order number, are valued, they must contain the same value. When results are transmitted in an ORU message, an ORC is not required, and the identifying placer order number must be present in the OBR segments.\n\nThese rules apply to the few other fields that are present in both ORC and OBR for upward compatibility (e.g., quantity/timing, parent numbers, ordering provider, and ordering call back numbers).",

The value of this OBX segment in the parent result is the organism or chemical species about which this battery reports. For example, if the current battery is an antimicrobial susceptibility, the parent results identified OBX contains a result which identifies the organism on which the susceptibility was run. This indirect linkage is preferred because the name of the organism in the parent result may undergo several preliminary values prior to finalization.\n\nThe third component may be used to record the name of the microorganism identified by the parent result directly. The organism in this case should be identified exactly as it is in the parent culture.\n\nWe emphasize that this field does not take the entire result field from the parent. It is meant only for the text name of the organism or chemical subspecies identified. This field is included only to provide a method for linking back to the parent result for those systems that could not generate unambiguous Observation IDs and sub-IDs.\n\nThis field is present only when the parent result is identified by OBR-29 Parent Results Observation Identifier or OBR-54 Parent Order, and the parent spawns child orders or results for each of many results. (See Chapter 7 for more details about this linkage.)\n\nA second mode of conveying this information is to use a standard observation result segment (OBX). If more than one organism is present, OBX-4-observation sub-ID is used to distinguish them. In this case, the first OBX with subID N will contain a value identifying the Nth microorganism, and each additional OBX with subID N will contain susceptibility values for a given antimicrobial test on this organism.",
