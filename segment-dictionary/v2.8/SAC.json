In the exchange between the LAS and LIS the Identified status can be used for reporting of the \"In Lab\" (Specimen Received) status. In some cases this may not be equal to the first event of sample recognition.\n\nIn Position status is used by one system to inform another that the container is in position for specimen transfer (e.g., container removal from track, pipetting, etc.).\n\nIn Process status is used by one system to inform another that the specific container is being processed by the equipment. It is useful as a response to a query about\nContainer Status, when the specific step of the process is not relevant.\n\nProcess Completed status is used by one system to inform another that the processing has been completed, but the container has not been released from that system.\n\nLeft Equipment status is used by one system to inform another that the container has been released from that system.\n\nMissing status is used by one system to inform another that the container did not arrive at its next expected location.\n\nCancelled status is used by one system to inform another that the container is no longer available within the scope of the system (e.g., tube broken or discarded).\n\nUnknown status is used by one system to inform another that the container has not been identified.",

Refer to User-defined Table 0378 \u2013 Carrier Type in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for suggested values. Because the geometry can be different, the carrier type should, if possible, express the number of positions in the carrier.\n\nThe definition assumes hierarchical nesting using the following phrases: container is located in a carrier; carrier is located in a tray.",
