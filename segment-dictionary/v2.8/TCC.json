We designate this coding system as ISO+. Both the ISO unit's abbreviations and the extensions are defined in Chapter 7, section 7.4.2.6.2 and listed in Figure 7-9. The ISO+ abbreviations are the codes for the default coding system. Consequently, when ISO+ units are being used, only ISO+ abbreviations need be sent, and the contents of the units field will be backward compatible to HL7 Version 2.1. For more information on this field see reference Chapter 7, section 7.4.2.6.\n\nThese units apply to fields \"Endogenous content of pre-dilution diluent\" and \"Equipment dynamic range\".",

However, in order to make the processing decisions easy the content can be a sequential number of the test sorted according to the criticality assigned by the lab. The lower numbers are more critical than higher numbers.\n\nThe element definition for TCC-15 Test Criticality in section 13.4.9.15 proposes an ambigous use of the CWE data type in. Currently the element definition indicates that a CWE data type is used; however, the definition also advises that the element can be populated with \"a sequential number of the test sorted according to the criticality assigned by the lab\". In general practice, the CWE data type references a table of assigned values, recognizing that those values are often assigned by the user. It is expected that the definition for this element will be reviewed and revised with the next release.",
