  "description": "The Participation Information segment contains the data necessary to add, update, correct, and delete from the record persons, organizations, or locations (participants) participating in the activity being transmitted.\n\nIn general, the PRT segment is used to describe a participant playing a particular role within the context of the message. In OO, for example, in the results messages the PRT segment may be used to provide the performing provider, whether a person or organization. In a specimen shipment message it may be the waypoint location relevant for the shipment.\n\nThe positional location of the PRT segment indicates the relationship. When the segment is used following the OBX segment, then the participations relate to the relevant participations in the result.",
