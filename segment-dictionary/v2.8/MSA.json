The receiving application is therefore unable to submit unsolicited messages. To mitigate this, a polling approach is used where the receiving application requests any queued messages when it is connected. To avoid the network overhead of continuous polling, the sending application needs a way to indicate that there are queued messages awaiting retrieval.
