  "description": "The Observation Request (OBR) segment is used to transmit information specific to an order for a diagnostic study or observation, physical exam, or assessment.\n\nThe daggered (+) items in this segment are not created by the placer. They are created by the filler and valued as needed when the OBR segment is returned as part of a report. Hence on a new order sent to the filler, they are not valued. There is an exception when the filler initiates the order. In that case, the filler order number is valued and the placer order number may be blank.\n\nThe starred (*) fields are only relevant when an observation is associated with a specimen. These are completed by the placer when the placer obtains the specimen. They are completed by the filler when the filler obtains the specimen.\n\nOBR-7-observation date/time and OBR-8-observation end date/time are the physiologically relevant times. In the case of an observation on a specimen, they represent the start and end of the specimen collector. In the case of an observation obtained directly from a subject (eg., BP, Chest Xray), they represent the start and end time of the observation",
