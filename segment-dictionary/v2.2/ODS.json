For ORC-1-order control, the values may be New (NW), Cancel (CA), Discontinue Order Request (DC), Change (XO), Hold Order Request (HD), and Release Previous Hold (RL). The HD and RL codes could stop service for a specified length of time. ORC-4-quantity/timing should be used to specify whether an order is continuous or for one service period only. It is also useful for supplements which are part of a diet but only delivered, say, every day at night",
