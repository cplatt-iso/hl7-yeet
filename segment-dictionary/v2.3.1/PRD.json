  "description": "This segment will be employed as part of a patient referral message and its related transactions. The PRD segment contains data specifically focused on a referral, and it is inter-enterprise in nature. The justification for this new segment comes from the fact that we are dealing with referrals that are external to the facilities that received them. Therefore, using a segment such as the current PV1 would be inadequate for all the return information that may be required by the receiving facility or application. In addition, the PV1 does not always provide information sufficient to enable the external facility to make a complete identification of the referring entity. The information contained in the PRD segment will include the referring provider, the referred-to provider, the referred-to location or service, and the referring provider clinic address.",

When a referral is inter-enterprise in nature, there are several important relationships that must be identified. For example, the proper identification of both the referring and the referred-to provider is critical for proper processing of a referral. In addition, some enterprises may want information regarding a consulting provider or the identity of the person who actually prepared the referral. This contact role may also expand to represent affiliated persons to whom information regarding this referral must be forwarded or copied. Refer to user-defined table 0286 - Provider role for suggested values.",

For example, if this provider represented the referred-to physician, the PRD-4-provider location should identify the clinic of the physician or provider to whom this referral has been sent. The identification of the provider's location is specified by an application and facility identifier carried in the facility field. The application ID and facility ID would be used in the same manner as their corresponding fields in the MSH segment (MSH-3-sending application, MSH-5-receiving application MSH-4-sending facility, MSH-6-receiving facility ). That is, the facility field will contain an application identifier and facility identifier which describe the location of this provider. However, it should be noted that they may describe a different location because the provider location being referenced in this field may not be the location from which the message originated, which is being described by the MSH.",
