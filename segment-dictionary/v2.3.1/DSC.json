In an initial query, this field is not present. If the responder returns a value of null or not present, then there is no more data to fulfill any future continuation requests. For use with continuations of unsolicited messages, see Sections 2.14.2, 'UDM/ACK - unsolicited display update message (event Q05),' and 2.23.2 'Continuation messages and segments.' Note that continuation protocols work with both display- and record-oriented messages.",
