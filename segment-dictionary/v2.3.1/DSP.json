The ancillary response will contain the report referenced by this result ID (e.g., accession number). The ancillary should correlate the result ID with DSP-4-logical break point as follows: If more than one line of text is sent per result, DSP-5-result ID should be only non-null for a DSP segment that contains a non-null DSP-4-logical break point. This field may be broken into components by local agreement. A common example might be to include placer order number, filler order number, and universal service identifier. Whenever such fields are used as components of the result ID, their components will be sent as subcomponents.",
