If it is valued, the responding system is required to echo it back as the first field in the query acknowledgment segment (QAK). This field differs from MSA-2-message control ID in that its value remains constant for each message (i.e., all continuation messages) associated with the query, whereas MSA-2-message control ID may vary with each continuation message, since it is associated with each individual message, not the query as a whole.",

A simple list of values (i.e., a one-dimensional array) may be passed instead of a single value by separating each value with the subcomponent delimiter: ' <segment field name> ^ <value1& value2 &...> .'
