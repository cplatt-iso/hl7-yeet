If it is valued, the responding system is required to echo it back as the first field in the query acknowledgment segment (QAK). This field differs from MSA-2-message control ID in that its value remains constant for each message (i.e., all continuation messages) associated with the query, whereas MSA-2-message control ID may vary with each continuation message, since it is associated with each individual message, not the query as a whole. QAK-1-Query tag is not conditional on the presence of the QRD-1-Query ID field in the original mode queries: in the original mode queries QAK-1-Query tag is not used.",
