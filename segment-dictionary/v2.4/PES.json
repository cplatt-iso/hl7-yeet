For example, the event identifier for the third event reported in 1996 by a manufacturer whose FDA-assigned registration number is 1234567 would be 1234567-1993-3. Organizations without a FDA-assigned registration number should use 0000000 until assigned a number. Reports from other facilities should use the 10-digit HCFA number left padded with zeros in place of the FDA-assigned registration number. The second through fourth components are defined in exactly the same way as the three components of the hierarchic designator (HD) data type (Section 2.8.18, HD - hierarchic designator).",
