  "description": "The Common Order segment (ORC) is used to transmit fields that are common to all orders (all types of services that are requested). The ORC segment is required in the Order (ORM) message. ORC is mandatory in Order Acknowledgment (ORR) messages if an order detail segment is present, but is not required otherwise.\n\nIf details are needed for a particular type of order segment (e.g., Pharmacy, Dietary), the ORC must precede any order detail segment (e.g., RXO, ODS). In some cases, the ORC may be as simple as the string ORC|OK|<placer order number>|<filler order number>|<cr>.\n\nIf details are not needed for the order, the order detail segment may be omitted. For example, to place an order on hold, one would transmit an ORC with the following fields completed: ORC-1-order control with a value of HD, ORC-2-placer order number, and ORC-3-filler order number",

Refer to HL7 table 0119 - Order control for valid entries.\n\nThis field may be considered the \u201ctrigger event\u201d identifier for orders. The codes fall roughly into the following three categories:\n\n1- Event request - Codes like \u201cNW\u201d (new order) and \u201cCA\u201d (cancel order request) are used to initiate an event. Event request codes are intended to initiate an event.\n\n2- Event acknowledgment - Codes like \u201cOK\u201d (order accepted) and \u201cCR\u201d (canceled as requested) are used to reply to the event request. Event acknowledgment codes are intended to reply to an application that requested an event.\n\n3- Event notification - Codes like \u201cOC\u201d (order canceled) and \u201cOD\u201d (order discontinued) are used to notify other applications that an event has occurred. No application reply is necessary. Event notification codes are intended to notify another application that, e.g., the filler has performed some action on an order that the other application, e.g., the placer, needs to know.\n\nFillers, placers, and other applications can use event requests, event acknowledgments, and event - notification-type trigger events interchangeably. However, certain order control codes can originate only from the filler (e.g., CR) and others can only originate from the placer (e.g., CA)",
