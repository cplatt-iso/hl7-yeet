It also contains several pharmacy-specific order status fields, such as RXE-16-number of refills remaining, RXE-17-number of refills/doses dispensed, RXE-18-date/time of most recent refill/dose, and RXE-19-total daily dose.\n\nNote that ORC-7-quantity/timing has a different meaning from RXE-1-quantity/timing and RXG-3quantity/timing. The pharmacy or treatment department has the \u201cauthority\u201d (and/or necessity) to schedule dispense/give events. Hence, the pharmacy or treatment department has the responsibility to encode this scheduling information in RXE-1-quantity/timing and RXG-3-quantity/timing.
