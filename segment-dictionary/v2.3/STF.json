  "description": "The STF segment can identify any personnel referenced by information systems. These can be providers, staff, system users, and referring agents. In a network environment, this segment can be used to define personnel to other applications; for example, order entry clerks, insurance verification clerks, admission clerks, as well as provider demographics. MFE-4-primary key value is used to link all the segments pertaining to the same master file entry. Therefore, in the MFE segment, MFE-4-primary key value must be filled in. Other segments may follow the STF segment to provide data for a particular type of staff member. The PRA segment (practitioner) is one such. It may optionally follow the STF segment in order to add practitioner-specific data. Other segments may be defined as needed.",
