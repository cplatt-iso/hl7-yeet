This segment can be used to send multiple-visit statistic records to the same patient account or single-visit records to more than one account. Individual sites must determine the use for this segment.\n\nPV1 usage notes\nThe facility (servicing) ID, the optional fourth component of each patient location field, is a string of up to six characters that is uniquely associated with the facility containing the location. A given institution, or group of intercommunicating institutions, should establish a list of facilities that may be potential assignors of patient locations. The list will be one of the institution\u2019s master dictionary lists. Since third parties other than the assignors of patient locations may send or receive HL7 messages containing patient locations, the facility ID in the patient location may not be the same as that implied by the sending and receiving systems identified in the MSH. The facility ID must be unique across facilities at a given site. This field is required for HL7 implementations that have more than a single facility with bed locations, since the same <nurse unit> ^ <room> ^ <bed> combination may exist at more than one facility.",
