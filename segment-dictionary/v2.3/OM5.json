      "description": "This field contains the codes and names of all tests/observations included within a single battery (nature code P, as described in OM1-18-nature of test/observation), a single functional procedure (nature code F), or a given superset (nature code S). When a segment includes a list of component elements, the sending system should be sure that the segments defining all of the components are sent before the segment that references them. An entry in this list can itself be a battery.\nThe individual test/observation IDs should be recorded as type CE, i.e., in the standard format for coded observation identifiers. Multiple observations should be separated by repeat delimiters\n\nIf the definition segment defined serum electrolytes, this field might look like the following:\n84132^potassium^AS4~\n84295^sodium^AS4~\n82435^chloride^AS4~\n82374^HCO3^^AS4~\n\nFor S (superset) parameters, this field contains the batteries that are included within the \u201csuper\u201d battery. For example, ROUTINES might be defined as:\n402^Electrolytes~352^Urinalysis~432^CBC~520^SMA12",

For example, a chest X-ray may use the suffixes IMP, REC, DEV, or others. Each of the expected suffixes should be listed here",
