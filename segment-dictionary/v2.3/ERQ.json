This enables the querying application to request detailed event data from an application that supports this feature, such that it may no longer be necessary for it to capture and store all event information at the time of the original trigger event.",

If it is valued, the responding system is required to echo it back as the first field in the query acknowledgment segment (QAK). This field differs from MSA-2-message control ID in that its value remains constant for each message (i.e., all continuation messages) associated with the query, whereas MSA-2- message control ID may vary with each continuation message, since it is associated with each individual message, not the query as a whole",

Hence, a value of \u201cA04\u201d in this field indicates a request for the data associated with the \u201cregister a patient\u201d trigger event. The ERP response message returns the contents of the \u201cregister a patient\u201d message defined in Chapter 3. If more than one match is found, the ERP returns repeating groups of the segments defined by the \u201cA04\u201d message",

A simple list of values (i.e., a one-dimensional array) may be passed instead of a single value by separating each value with the subcomponent delimiter: \u201c<field name> ^ <value1&value2 &...>\u201d Refer to Section 2.24.16.4, \u201cEQL query statement (ST) 00710,\u201d for field naming conventions.\nFor example, , a value of \u201c@00122^123-45-6789\u201d could be combined with the A04 event identifier to request patient registration data for the patient with the social security number 123-45-6789.",
