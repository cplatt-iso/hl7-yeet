  "description": "The OBX segment is used to transmit a single observation or observation fragment. It represents the smallest indivisible unit of a report.\n\nIts principal mission is to carry information about observations in report messages. But the OBX can also be part of an observation order (see Section 4.2, \u201cOrder Message Definitions\u201d). In this case, the OBX carries clinical information needed by the filler to interpret the observation the filler makes. For example, an OBX is needed to report the inspired oxygen on an order for a blood oxygen to a blood gas lab, or to report the menstrual phase information which should be included on an order for a pap smear to a cytology lab. Appendix 7A includes codes for identifying many of pieces of information needed by observation producing services to properly interpret a test result. OBX is also found in other HL7 messages that need to include patient clinical information.",

Code W indicates that the result has been verified to be wrong (incorrect); a replacement (corrected) result may be transmitted later. Code C indicates that data contained in the OBX-5-observation value field are to replace previously transmitted (verified and) final result data with the same observation ID (including suffix, if applicable) and observation sub-ID usually because the previous results were wrong. Code D indicates that data previously transmitted in a result segment with the same observation ID (including suffix) and observation sub-ID should be deleted. When changing or deleting a result, multiple OBX segments with the same observation ID and observation sub-ID are replaced or deleted as a unit. Normal progression of results through intermediate (e.g., \u2018gram positive cocci\u2019) to final (e.g., \u2018staphylococcus aureus\u2019) should not be transmitted as C (correction); they should be transmitted as P or S (depending upon the specific case) until they are final",

An example is an antimicrobial susceptibility result. Some systems prefer to display only the susceptibility results of inexpensive antimicrobials depending upon the organism, the source of the specimen and the patient\u2019s allergy status. The sending service wants to send all of the susceptibilities so that certain privileged users (e.g., Infectious Disease specialists) can review all of the results but nonprivileged users would see only the \u201cpreferred\u201d antimicrobials to which the organism was susceptible.

In France, requesting services routinely send a set of the last observations along with the request for a new set of observations. The date of these observations is important to the filler laboratories.\n\nIn all cases, the observation date-time is the physiologically relevant date-time or the closest approximation to that date-time. In the case of tests performed on specimens, the relevant date-time is the specimen\u2019s collection date-time.

If the value is CE then the result must be a coded entry. When the value type is TX or FT then the results are bulk text. The valid values for the value type of an observation are listed in HL7 table 0125 - Value type.\n\nThe observation value must be represented according to the format for the data type defined in Chapter 2, Section 2.8, \u201cData Types.\u201d For example, a PN consists of 6 components, separated by component delimiters.\n\nAlthough NM is a valid type, observations which are usually reported as numbers will sometimes have the string (ST) data type because non-numeric characters are often reported as part of the result, e.g., >300 to indicate the result was off-scale for the instrument. In the example, \">300\", \">\" is a symbol and the digits are considered a numeric value. However, this usage of the ST type should be discouraged since the SN (structured numeric) data type now accommodates such reporting and, in addition, permits the receiving system to interpret the magnitude.\n\nAll HL7 data types are valid, and are included in Table 0125 except CM, CQ, SI, and ID. For a CM definition to have meaning, the specifics about the CM must be included in the field definition. OBX-5-observation value is a general field definition that is influenced by the data type OBX-3, so CMs are undefined in this context. CQ is invalid because units for OBX-5-observation value are always specified explicitly in an OBX segment with OBX-6 units. SI is invalid because it only applied to HL7 message segments, and ID because it requires a constant field definition.\n\nThe RP value (reference pointer) must be used if the actual observation value is not sent in OBX but exists somewhere else. For example, if the observation consists of an image (document or medical), the image itself cannot be sent in OBX. The sending system may in that case opt to send a reference pointer. The receiving system can use this reference pointer whenever it needs access to the actual image through other interface standards, e.g., DICOM, or through appropriate data base servers",

The relation of an observation ID to a master observation table is analogous to the relationship between a charge code (in a billing record) and the charge master.\n\nWhen local codes are used as the first identifier in this field we strongly encourage sending a universal identifier as well to permit receivers to equivalence results from different providers of the same service (e.g., a hospital lab and commercial lab that provides serum potassium to a nursing home). One possible universal identifier is LOINC codes for laboratory and clinical measurements (see Figure 7-3 and the HL7 www list server); see Section 7.15, \u201cWAVEFORM RESULT DATA TYPES,\u201d and Appendix X2 of ASTM E1467 for neurophysiology tests.",
