The second component is the text associated with the code. The third component is the identification of the code table source. When only a text description of a possible answer is available, it is recorded as ^<text>.\n\nCare should be taken to transmit only those results that are considered normal for that test. A drug screen may have possible results of \u201cnegative\u201d and \u201cpositive.\u201d However, only a result of \u201cnegative\u201d is considered to be normal.
