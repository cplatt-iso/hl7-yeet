This field may be either a CE or PL data type. The PL data type is used only on Location master transactions. When the CE data type is used, the first component of this CE data field carries an optional subcomponent, the application ID, that uniquely identifies the application responsible for creating the primary key value. The application ID subcomponent can be used to guarantee uniqueness of the primary key across multiple applications.\n\nThe repetition of the primary key permits the identification of an individual component of a complex record as the object of the record-level event code. This feature allows the Master Files protocol to be used for modifications of single components of complex records",
